=== Simple Social ===

Adds facebook like and tweet button to posts without loading remote javascript libraries.

== Description ==

Most options that add social buttons use default Facebook and Twitter javascript libraries, slowing down your site. This plugin doesn't use those libraries, instead it uses option to load share/tweet page via url. It opens this page in popup or in new tab(if on mobile), only when user clicks the button, therefore eliminating unnecessary network requests.

== Installation ==

e.g.

1. Upload simple-social folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
